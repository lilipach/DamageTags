# DamageTags
Created a simple html damage tag form for work tags.
Form is meant to be used with zebra printers but can be used with anything. 
Allows me to scan item asset tags instead of having to write it down everytime by hand.
Date and name segment of tag is now automated as well. This will also prevent me from 
having to pre-print and cut asset tags for use. Zebra printer asins are also sticky so 
I will no longer need tape.
